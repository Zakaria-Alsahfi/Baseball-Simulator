# Baseball-Simulator
Taking baseball data for MLB teams from 2000-2018 and using them to generate VBA functions to compare teams from any year or a team against themselves in a different year. There were excel functions to improve the format of the entire workbook. Our goal was to make a tool that could quickly and easily compare any two teams over the 18 years of data we collected.
